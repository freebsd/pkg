- CONTRIBUTE: fix syntax in commit message description

  File 'docs/CONTRIBUTE.md' includes a description of how one should write
  commit messages in the curl project.  Different possible parts of the

  describing how the curl project doesn't use "Signed-off-by" commit
  trailers [1], which is enclosed in an opening curly brace paired with a
  closing square bracket.

- quiche: fix segfault and other things

  - refs #11449 where a segfault is reported when IP Eyeballing did
    not immediately connect but made several attempts
  - The transfer initiating the eyeballing was initialized  too early,
    leadding to references to the filter instance that was then
    replaced in the subsequent eyeball attempts. That led to a use
    after free in the buffer handling for the transfer
  - transfers are initiated now more lazy (like in the ngtcp2 filter),
    when the stream is actually opened
  - suppress reporting on quiche event errors for "other" transfers
    than the current one to not fail a transfer due to faults in
    another one.
  - revert recent return value handling for quiche_h3_recv_body()
    to not indicate an error but an EAGAIN situation. We wish quiche
    would document what functions return.

- http2: treat initial SETTINGS as a WINDOW_UPDATE

  - refs #11426 where spurious stalls on large POST requests

  - the issue seems to involve the following
    * first stream on connection adds up to 64KB of POST
      data, which is the max default HTTP/2 stream window size
      transfer is set to HOLD
    * initial SETTINGS from server arrive, enlarging the stream
      window. But no WINDOW_UPDATE is received.
    * curl stalls

    relying on a WINDOW_UPDATE from lazy servers

- cf-socket: don't bypass fclosesocket callback if cancelled before connect

  After upgrading to 8.1.2 from 7.84.0, I found that sockets were being
  closed without calling the fclosesocket callback if a request was
  cancelled after the associated socket was created, but before the socket
  was connected. This lead to an imbalance of fopensocket & fclosesocket
  callbacks, causing problems with a custom event loop integration using
  the multi-API.

  This was caused by cf_socket_close() calling sclose() directly instead
  of calling socket_close() if the socket was not active. For regular TCP
  client connections, the socket is activated by cf_socket_active(), which
  is only called when the socket completes the connect.

  As far as I can tell, this issue has existed since 7.88.0. That is,
  since the code in question was introduced by:
      commit 71b7e0161032927cdfb4e75ea40f65b8898b3956

- hostip.c: Move macOS-specific calls into global init call

  https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/7121 introduced a macOS system call
  to `SCDynamicStoreCopyProxies`, which is invoked every time an IP
  address needs to be resolved.

  However, this system call is not thread-safe, and macOS will kill the
  process if the system call is run first in a fork. To make it possible
  for the parent process to call this once and prevent the crash, only
  invoke this system call in the global initialization routine.

  In addition, this change is beneficial because it:

  1. Avoids extra macOS system calls for every IP lookup.
  2. Consolidates macOS-specific initialization in a separate file.

- runtests: use more consistent failure lines

  After a test failure log a consistent log message to make it easier to

  perhaps be counted in the skipped category, but this commit does not
  change that behaviour.

- runtests: better detect and handle pipe errors in the controller

  Errors reading and writing to the pipes are now better detected and
  propagated up to the main test loop so it can be cleanly shut down. Such
  errors are usually due to a runner dying so it doesn't make much sense
  to try to continue the test run.

- runtests: cleanly abort the runner if the controller dies

  If the controller dies unexpectedly, have the runner stop its servers
  and exit cleanly. Otherwise, the orphaned servers will stay running in
  the background.

- runtests: improve error logging

  Give more information about test harness error conditions to help figure
  out what might be wrong. Print some internal test state when SIGUSR1 is
  sent to runtests.pl.

  Ref: #11328

- runtests: better handle ^C during slow tests

  Since the SIGINT handler now just sets a flag that must be checked in the
  main controller loop, make sure that runs periodically.  Rather than
  blocking on a response from a test runner near the end of the test run,
  add a short timeout to allow it.

- runtests: rename server command file

  The name ftpserver.cmd was historical and has been used for more than
  ftp for many years now. Rename it to plain server.cmd to reduce
  confusion.

- tests: improve reliability of TFTP tests

  Stop checking the timeout used by the client under test (for most
  tests). The timeout will change if the TFTP test server is slow (such as
  happens on an overprovisioned CI server) because the client will retry
  and reduce its timeout, and the actual value is not important for most
  tests.

  test285 is changed a different way, by increasing the connect timeout.
  This improves test coverage by allowing the changed timeout value to be
  checked, but improves reliability with a carefully-chosen timeout that
  not only allows twice the time to respond as before, but also allows
  several retries before the client will change its timeout value.

  Ref: #11328

- cf-socket: skip getpeername()/getsockname for TFTP

  Since the socket is not connected then the call fails. When the call
  fails, failf() is called to write an error message that is then
  surviving and is returned when the *real* error occurs later. The
  earlier, incorrect, error therefore hides the actual error message.

  This could be seen in stderr for test 1007

  Test 1007 has now been extended to verify the stderr message.

- runtests; give each server a unique log lock file

  Logs are written by several servers and all of them must be finished
  writing before the test results can be determined. This means each
  server must have its own lock file rather than sharing a single one,
  which is how it was done up to now. Previously, the first server to
  complete a test would clear the lock before the other server was done,
  which caused flaky tests.

  Lock files are now all found in their own directory, so counting locks
  equals counting the files in that directory.  The result is that the
  proxy logs are now reliably written which actually changes the expected
  output for two tests.

- cmake: add support for "unity" builds

  Aka "jumbo" or "amalgamation" builds. It means to compile all sources
  per target as a single C source. This is experimental.

  You can enable it by passing `-DCMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=ON` to cmake.
  It requires CMake 3.16 or newer.

  It makes builds (much) faster, allows for better optimizations and tends
  to promote less ambiguous code.

  Also add a new AppVeyor CI job and convert an existing one to use
  "unity" mode (one MSVC, one MinGW), and enable it for one macOS CI job.

  Fix related issues:
  - add missing include guard to `easy_lock.h`.
  - rename static variables and functions (and a macro) with names reused
    across sources, or shadowed by local variables.
  - add an `#undef` after use.
  - add a missing `#undef` before use.
  - move internal definitions from `ftp.h` to `ftp.c`.
  - `curl_memory.h` fixes to make it work when included repeatedly.
  - stop building/linking curlx bits twice for a static-mode curl tool.
    These caused doubly defined symbols in unity builds.
  - silence missing extern declarations compiler warning for ` _CRT_glob`.
  - fix extern declarations for `tool_freq` and `tool_isVistaOrGreater`.
  - fix colliding static symbols in debug mode: `debugtime()` and
    `statename`.
  - rename `ssl_backend_data` structure to unique names for each
    TLS-backend, along with the `ssl_connect_data` struct member
    referencing them. This required adding casts for each access.
  - add workaround for missing `[P]UNICODE_STRING` types in certain Windows
    builds when compiling `lib/ldap.c`. To support "unity" builds, we had
    to enable `SCHANNEL_USE_BLACKLISTS` for Schannel (a Windows
    `schannel.h` option) _globally_. This caused an indirect inclusion of
    Windows `schannel.h` from `ldap.c` via `winldap.h` to have it enabled
    as well. This requires `[P]UNICODE_STRING` types, which is apperantly
    not defined automatically (as seen with both MSVS and mingw-w64).
    This patch includes `<subauth.h>` to fix it.

  This change replaces the previous method of picking a port number at

  socket on port zero, thereby getting a suitable random port set by the
  kernel. That server socket is then closed and that port number is used
  to setup the actual test server on.

  There is a risk that *another* server can be started on the machine in
  the time gap, but the server verification feature will detect that.

  If you try to assign and export on the same line on some older /bin/sh
  implementations, it complains:

  ```
  $ export "NAME=value"
  NAME=value: is not an identifier
  ```

  This commit rewrites run-compiler's assignments and exports to work with
  old /bin/sh, splitting assignment and export into two separate
  statements, and only quote the value. So now we have:

  ```
  NAME="value"
  export NAME

  assign+export lines preceeding the script to be consistent with how
  exports work throughout the rest of configure.ac.

  Originally these scripts filtered out names that have no space so that

  Additionally: non-latin names, like Asian, don't have spaces at all so
  they were also filtered out and had to be manually added which made it
  an error-prone operation where Asian names eventually easily fell off by
  mistake.

- configure: fix build with arbitrary CC and LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  Since ./configure and processes that inherit its environment variables
  are the only callers of the run-compiler script, we can just save the
  current value of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CC variables to another pair of
  environment variables, and make run-compiler a static script that
  simply restores CC and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the saved value, and before
  running the compiler.

  This avoids having to inject the values of the variables in the script,
  possibly causing problems if they contains spaces, quotes, and other
  special characters.

  Also add exports in the script just in case LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CC are
  not already in the environment.

- http2: fix EOF handling on uploads with auth negotiation

  - doing a POST with `--digest` does an override on the initial request
    with `Content-Length: 0`, but the http2 filter was unaware of that
    and expected the originally request body. It did therefore not
    send a final DATA frame with EOF flag to the server.
  - The fix overrides any initial notion of post size when the `done_send`
    event is triggered by the transfer loop, leading to the EOF that
    is necessary.
  - refs #11194. The fault did not happen in testing, as Apache httpd
    never tries to read the request body of the initial request,
    sends the 401 reply and closes the stream. The server used in the
    reported issue however tried to read the EOF and timed out on the
    request.

- http/2: unstick uploads

  - refs #11157 and #11175 where uploads get stuck or lead to RST streams
  - fixes our h2 send behaviour to continue sending in the nghttp2 session
    as long as it wants to. This will empty our send buffer as long as
    the remote stream/connection window allows.
  - in case the window is exhausted, the data remaining in the send buffer
    will wait for a WINDOW_UPDATE from the server. Which is a socket event
    that engages our transfer loop again
  - the problem in the issue was that we did not exhaust the window, but
    left data in the sendbuffer and no further socket events did happen.
    The server was just waiting for us to send more.
  - relatedly, there was an issue fixed that closing a stream with KEEP_HOLD
    set kept the transfer from shutting down - as it should have - leading
    to a timeout.

- Revert "urlapi: respect CURLU_ALLOW_SPACE and CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY for redirect
  s"

  This reverts commit df6c2f7b544f1f35f2a3e0be11f345affeb6fe9c.
  (It only keep the test case that checks redirection to an absolute URL
  without hostname and CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY).

  I originally wanted to make CURLU_ALLOW_SPACE accept spaces in the
  hostname only because I thought
  curl_url_set(CURLUPART_URL, CURLU_ALLOW_SPACE) was already accepting
  them, and they were only not being accepted in the hostname when
  curl_url_set(CURLUPART_URL) was used for a redirection.

  That is not actually the case, urlapi never accepted hostnames with
  spaces, and a hostname with a space in it never makes sense.
  I probably misread the output of my original test when I they were
  normally accepted when using CURLU_ALLOW_SPACE, and not redirecting.

  Some other URL parsers seems to allow space in the host part of the URL,
  e.g. both python3's urllib.parse module, and Chromium's javascript URL
  object allow spaces (chromium percent escapes the spaces with %20),
  (they also both ignore TABs, and other whitespace characters), but those
  URLs with spaces in the hostname are useless, neither python3's requests
  module nor Chromium's window.location can actually use them.

  There is no reason to add support for URLs with spaces in the host,
  since it was not a inconsistency bug; let's revert that patch before it
  makes it into release. Sorry about that.

  I also reverted the extra check for CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY since that does
  not seem to be necessary, CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY already worked for
  redirects.

- checksrc: disallow spaces before labels

  Out of 415 labels throughout the code base, 86 of those labels were
  not at the start of the line. Which means labels always at the start of
  the line is the favoured style overall with 329 instances.

  Out of the 86 labels not at the start of the line:
  * 75 were indented with the same indentation level of the following line
  * 8 were indented with exactly one space
  * 2 were indented with one fewer indentation level then the following
    line
  * 1 was indented with the indentation level of the following line minus
    three space (probably unintentional)

  the standard curl response timeout setting to also control the time that
  libssh2 will wait for packets from a slow server.  This is necessary to
  enable use of very slow SFTP servers.

  removed.

  I also fixed a comment that was misaligned in CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION.3.

  And I fixed some formatting inconsistencies: in curl_unescape(3), all
  function parameter were mentioned with bold text except length, that was
  mentioned as 'length'; and, in curl_easy_unescape(3), all parameters
  were mentioned in bold text except url that was italicised. Now they are
  all mentioned in bold.
  Documentation is not very consistent in how function parameter are

  - `drain` was used by http/2 and http/3 implementations to indicate

    poll state. Intended as a counter, it was used as bool flag only.
  - a similar mechanism exists on `connectdata->cselect_bits` where
    specific protocols can indicate something similar, only for the
    whole connection.
  - `cselect_bits` are cleard in transfer.c on use and, importantly,
    also set when the transfer loop expended its `maxloops` tries.
    `drain` was not cleared by transfer and the http2/3 implementations
    had to take care of that.
  - `dselect_bits` is cleared *and* set by the transfer loop. http2/3
    does no longer clear it, only set when new events happen.

  This change unifies the handling of socket poll overrides, extending
  `cselect_bits` by a easy handle specific value and a common treatment in
  transfers.

- runtests: support buffering log messages in runner & servers

  Log messages generated with logmsg can now be buffered and returned from
  the runner as a return value.  This will be needed with parallel testing
  to allow all messages for one test to be displayed together instead of
  interspersed with messages of multiple tests. Buffering can be disabled
  by setting a logging callback function with setlogfunc, which is
  currently being done to preserve existing logging behaviour for now.

  Some additional output is generated in verbose and debugprotocol modes,
  which don't always use logmsg. These modes also impact some servers
  which generate extra messages. No attempt is made to buffer everything
  if these modes are enabled.

- runtests: display logs on server failure in singletest()

  This is closer to the place where logs are displayed on test failure.
  Also, only display these logs if -p is given, which is the same flag
  that controls display of test failure logs. Some server log files
  need to be deleted later so that they stay around long enough to be
  displayed on failure.

Dan Fandrich (22 Apr 2023)

- runtests: move showdiff into runtests.pl

  It's not used anywhere else.

- devtest: add a new script for testing the test harness

  This is currently useful for starting a test server on its own without
  an associated test, which can be used for interactive curl testing or
  for validating parts of the test harness itself. More commands can be
  added to perform additional functions in the future.

  Ref: #10818
  Closes #11008

- runtests: refactor the main test loop into two

  The test loop now has an initial loop that first runs through all
  possible tests to build a set of those to attempt on this run based on
  features and keywords and only then goes through that new list to run
  them.  This actually makes it three loops through all tests cases, as
  there is an existing loop that gathers possible test numbers from the
  test files on disk.

  This has two minor effects on the output: all the tests that will be
  skipped are displayed at the start (instead of being interspersed with
  other tests) and the -l option no longer shows a count of tests at the
  end or a (misleading) statement that tests have run successfully. The
  skipped tests are also omitted from the test results sent to AppVeyor
  and Azure in CI builds.

  Another effect is a reduction in the amount of work considered part of
  the "Test definition reading and preparation time" reported with -r
  making those figures slightly lower than before.

  Ref: #10818

- runtests: track only the current test timings in runner.pm

  This avoids passing these data through through global variables, which
  soon won't be possible.

  Ref: #10818

- runtests: skip test preprocessing when doing -l

  This speeds up the output tremendously by avoiding unnecessary work.

- runtests: simplify value returned regarding use of valgrind

  As a side effect this will now also show in verbose mode that valgrind
  is being skipped on tests that explicitly disable it, such as 600.

  Ref: #10818

- runtests: fix quoting in Appveyor and Azure test integration

  Test 1442's name was not quoted correctly so wasn't registered in
  Appveyor and it had the wrong name in Azure. The JSON string quotes were
  also invalid, even though both servers happened to accept it regardless.

  Closes #11010

- runtests: spread out the port numbers used by servers

  The server ports are chosen randomly for each server, but the random
  ranges chosen were inconsistently-sized and overlapping. Now, they are
  spread out more so at least the first random port chosen for each server
  is guaranteed to not also be chosen by another server. The starting port
  numbers are also raised to put them in the Ephemeral Port range—not the
  range defined by RFC 6335 but the one used by Linux, which starts lower
  and gives us more room to work with.

  Reported-by: Daniel Stenberg

- runtests: fix problems on <killserver> failure

  The verify time must be set in this case, like all cases. An error
  message needs to be displayed as well.

- runtests: fix perl warning when <tool> is wrong

- runtests: don't try to stop stunnel before trying again

  Calling stopserver() before retrying stunnel due to an error would stop
  the dependent server (such as HTTP) meaning stunnel would have nothing
  to talk to when it came up. Don't try to force a stop when it didn't
  actually start.  Also, don't mark the server as bad for future use when
  it starts up on a retry.

  Reported-by: eaglegai at github
  Tested-by: eaglegai at github
  Fixes #10976

- runtests: don't accidentally randomly choose the same port

  If a server couldn't be started on a port, a new one is randomly chosen
  and the server is tried again. Avoid accidentally using a
  randomly-chosen 0 port offset by adding 1 to the random number.

  Found-by: Daniel Stenberg

- runtests: don't attempt to use a port we know is in use

  This reduces the startup time when there is a known conflict on the
  random port chosen for a server.  This was already done for stunnel, but
  now it's done for all servers.

- http-server: fix server name in a log message

  This changed when the file was renamed in commit cbf57176

- runtests: refactor into more packages

  testutil.pm now contains a few miscellaneous functions that are used in
  several places but have no better place to live.  subvariables moves to
  servers.pm since most variables that it substitutes relate to servers,
  so this is the most appropriate place. Rename a few functions for better
  naming consistency.

  Closes #10995

- runtests: call timestampskippedevents() in singletest

  ..rather than by the runner

- runtests: assume a newer Valgrind by default

  The tests for an older Valgrind version should probably just be deleted,

- runtests: refactor test runner code into runner.pm

  This is code that is directly responsible for running a single test.
  This will eventually run in a separate process as part of the parallel
  testing project.

- runtests: skip unneeded work if test won't be running

- test303: kill server after test

  Otherwise, an HTTP test closely following this one with a tight time

  Closes #10898

- http2: move HTTP/2 stream vars into local context

  - remove NGHTTP2 members of `struct HTTP`
  - add `void *h2_ctx` to `struct HTTP`
  - add `void *h3_ctx` to `struct HTTP`
  - separate h2/h3 pointers are needed for eyeballing
  - manage local stream_ctx in http implementations

  Closes #10877

- proxy: http2 proxy tunnel implementation

  - currently only on debug build and when env variable
    CURL_PROXY_TUNNEL_H2 is present.
  - will ALPN negotiate with the proxy server and switch
    tunnel filter based on the protocol negotiated.
  - http/1.1 tunnel code moved into cf-h1-proxy.[ch]
  - http/2 tunnel code implemented in cf-h2-proxy.[ch]
  - tunnel start and ALPN set remains in http_proxy.c
  - moving all haproxy related code into cf-haproxy.[ch]

  VTLS changes
  - SSL filters rely solely on the "alpn" specification they
    are created with and no longer check conn->bits.tls_enable_alpn.
  - checks on which ALPN specification to use (or none at all) are
    done in vtls.c when creating the filter.

  Testing
  - added a nghttpx forward proxy to the pytest setup that
    speaks HTTP/2 and forwards all requests to the Apache httpd
    forward proxy server.
  - extending test coverage in test_10 cases
  - adding proxy tests for direct/tunnel h1/h2 use of basic auth.
  - adding test for http/1.1 and h2 proxy tunneling to pytest

  Closes #10780

- vtls and h2 improvements

  - eliminate receive loop in vtls to fill buffer. This may
    lead to partial reads of data which is counter productive
  - let http2 instead loop smarter to process pending network
    data without transfer switches

  scorecard improvements
  - do not start caddy when only httpd is requested
  - allow curl -v to stderr file on --curl-verbose

  Closes #10891

Daniel Stenberg (6 Apr 2023)

- tests: 1078 1288 1297 use valid IPv4 addresses

  With the enhanced URL parser, these tests failed because of their bad
  IPv4 use.

- urlapi: detect and error on illegal IPv4 addresses

  Using bad numbers in an IPv4 numerical address now returns
  CURLUE_BAD_HOSTNAME.

  I noticed while working on trurl and it was originally reported here:
  https://github.com/curl/trurl/issues/78

  Updated test 1560 accordingly.

  Closes #10894

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced

- urlapi: URL encoding for the URL missed the fragment

  Meaning that it would wrongly still store the fragment using spaces
  instead of %20 if allowing space while also asking for URL encoding.

    url.path, url.query, url.fragment, url.zoneid

  Add the following for outputting parts of the "effective URL":

   urle.scheme, urle.user, urle.password, urle.options, urle.host, urle.port,
   urle.path, urle.query, urle.fragment, urle.zoneid

- configure: make quiche require quiche_conn_send_ack_eliciting

  curl now requires quiche version >= 1.17.1 to be used and this function
  was added in this version and makes a convenient check.

  This requirement is because this is the lowest quiche version that
  supports peer-initiated key updates correctly.

  Closes #10886

Dan Fandrich (1 Apr 2023)

- unit tests: use the unit test infrastructure better

  Allow UNITTEST_STOP to return the error code, use the fail & abort
  macros to indicate test failure and return success instead of fail if
  the unit test can't test anything because of missing features at
  compile-time.  A couple of tests could never fail because they were
  overriding the failure return code.

- runtests: strip EOL on precheck output on Windows, too

  Precheck failures would show on two lines in the test summary output
  otherwise.

- tests: move server config files under the pid dir

  These files are generated by the test servers and must therefore be
  found in the log directory to make them available to only those servers
  once multiple test runners are executing in parallel. They must also not
  be deleted with the log files, so they are stored in the pidfile
  directory.

  Ref: #10818
  Closes #10875

- runtests: use the ssh key filenames from the sshhelp package

- tests: move pidfiles and portfiles under the log directory

  This is to segregate all files written by a test process into a single

  Closes #10874

- runtests: minor code cleanups

- runtests: call processexists() and pidfromfile()

  rather than duplicating the logic in several places.

- test1471/2: add http as a required feature

  curl bails out early with a different error message if http support is
  compiled out.

  Ref: #10705

- tests: limit return code of unit tests and lib tests

  Values greater than 125 have special meanings, so cap it there.  Unit
  tests and lib tests use the number of failures as the return code, so a
  large number of failures (such as test 2601 as a torture test) can
  exceed this causing the test to be erroneously reported as having
  failed.

  Ref: #10720

- test1960: point to the correct path for the precheck tool

  Otherwise, it might find the binary in .libs which can cause it to use

- testcurl: bump version date

  It hadn't been updated in 9 years; it's time.

- tests: switch to 3-argument open in test suite

  The perl 2-argument open has been considered not-quite-deprecated since
  the 3-argument form was introduced almost a quarter century ago.

- tests: silence some Perl::Critic warnings in test suite

  Not all warnings are fixed; many are as much stylistic suggestions than
  anything and IMHO don't do much to actually improve the code.

  Ref: #10818
  Closes #10861

- docs: bump the minimum perl version to 5.6

  It's actually been this way since at least 2012 (when a 3-argument open
  was added to runtests.pl). Given the lack of complaints in the interim,
  it's safe to call this 23 year old perl version the minimum.

- runtests: memoize the getpart* subroutines to speed up access

  The refactored code calls these functions with the same arguments more
  often, so this prevents redundant test case file parsing.

- runtests: more refactoring for clarity

- runtests: don't start servers if -l is given

- runtests: refactor singletest() into separate functions

  This takes it from a 1200 line behemoth into something more manageable.
  The content and order of the functions is taken almost directly from
  singletest() so the diff sans whitespace is quite short.

  Ref: #10818

- runtests: refactor singletest() into distinct sections

  Namely:
  - Verify that this test case should be run
  - Start the servers needed to run this test case
  - Check that test environment is fine to run this test case
  - Prepare the test environment to run this test case
  - Run the test command
  - Clean up after test command
  - Verify test succeeded

  Ref: #10818

- runtests: stop copying a few arrays where not needed

  Unlike some other languages that just copy a pointer, perl copies the
  entire array contents which takes time for a large array.

  Ref: #10818

- runtests: reduce redundant calls to getpart/getpartattr

  These functions scan through the entire test file every time to find the

- cmake: picky-linker fixes for openssl, ZLIB, H3 and more

  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls built with ZLIB.
    (Requires curl be built with ZLIB option also.)

  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with OpenSSL/quictls/LibreSSL and `ld`
    linker on Windows.

  - fix HTTP/3 support detection with wolfSSL to automatically add
    `ws2_32` to the lib list on Windows. For all linkers.

  - reposition ZLIB (and other compression) detection _after_ TLS
    detection, but before calling HTTP/3-support detection via
    `CheckQuicSupportInOpenSSL`.

    May be a regression from ebef55a61df0094b9790710a42f63c48e7de3c13
    May fix #10832 (Reported-by: Micah Snyder)

    This also seems to fix an odd case, where OpenSSL/quictls is correctly
    detected, but its header path is not set while compiling, breaking
    build at `src/curl_ntlm_core.c`. Reason for this remains undiscovered.

  - satisfy "picky" linkers such as `ld` with MinGW, that are highly
    sensitive to lib order, by also adding brotli to the beginning of the
    lib list.

  - satisfy "picky" linkers by adding certain Windows systems libs to
    the lib list for OpenSSL/LibreSSL. (Might need additional ones for
    other forks, such as `pthread` for BoringSSL.)

  Note: It'd make sense to _always_ add `ws2_32`, `crypt32` (except
  Windows App targets perhaps?), `bcrypt` (except old-mingw!) on Windows
  at this point. They are almost always required, and if some aren't,
  they are ignored by the linker with no effect on final binaries.

- lib: add `bufq` and `dynhds`

  Adding `bufq`:
  - at init() time configured to hold up to `n` chunks of `m` bytes each.
  - various methods for reading from and writing to it.
  - `peek` support to get access to buffered data without copy
  - `pass` support to allow buffer flushing on write if it becomes full
  - use case: IO buffers for dynamic reads and writes that do not blow up
  - distinct from `dynbuf` in that:
    - it maintains a read position
    - writes on a full bufq return CURLE_AGAIN instead of nuking itself
  - Init options:
    - SOFT_LIMIT: allow writes into a full bufq
    - NO_SPARES: free empty chunks right away
  - a `bufc_pool` that can keep a number of spare chunks to
    be shared between different `bufq` instances

  Adding `dynhds`:
  - a straightforward list of name+value pairs as used for HTTP headers
  - headers can be appended dynamically
  - headers can be removed again
  - headers can be replaced
  - headers can be looked up
  - http/1.1 formatting into a `dynbuf`
  - configured at init() with limits on header counts and total string
    sizes
  - use case: pass a HTTP request or response around without being version
    specific
  - express a HTTP request without a curl easy handle (used in h2 proxy
    tunnels)
  - future extension possibilities:
    - conversions of `dynhds` to nghttp2/nghttp3 name+value arrays

- multi: remove PENDING + MSGSENT handles from the main linked list

  As they are not driving transfers or any socket activity, the main loop
  does not need to iterate over these handles. A performance improvement.

  They are instead only held in their own separate lists.

  'data->multi' is kept a pointer to the multi handle as long as the easy
  handle is actually part of it even when the handle is moved to the
  pending/msgsent lists. It needs to know which multi handle it belongs
  to, if for example curl_easy_cleanup() is called before the handle is
  removed from the multi handle.

  Alll 'data->multi' pointers of handles still part of the multi handle
  gets cleared by curl_multi_cleanup() which "orphans" all previously
  attached easy handles.

  This is take 2. The first version was reverted for the 8.0.1 release.

- wolfssl: add quic/ngtcp2 detection in cmake, and fix builds

  - add QUIC/ngtcp2 detection in CMake with wolfSSL.

    Because wolfSSL uses zlib if available, move compression detection
    before TLS detection. (OpenSSL might also need this in the future.)

  - wolfSSL 5.5.0 started using C99 types in its `quic.h` header, but it
    doesn't #include the necessary C99 header itself, breaking builds
    (unless another dependency pulled it by chance.) Add local workaround
    for it. For this to work with all build tools, we had to fix our

  Fix `stdint.h` and `inttypes.h` detection with non-autotools builds on

  `lib/config-win32.h` builds (e.g. `Makefile.mk`):
  - set `HAVE_STDINT_H` where supported.
  - set `HAVE_INTTYPES_H` for MinGW.

  CMake:
  - auto-detect them on Windows. (They were both force-disabled.)
  - delete unused `CURL_PULL_STDINT_H`.
  - delete unused `CURL_PULL_INTTYPES_H`.
  - stop detecting `HAVE_STDINT_H` twice.

  curl doesn't use these C99 headers, we need them now to workaround

- tests: make first.c the same for both lib tests and unit tests

  The only difference used to be global variable used in unittest tests.
  After cb7ed5a removed individual flag overrides for the unittests, first.c
  was no longer recompiled for unit tests to include the flag, so whether it
  worked or gave a link error depended on whether it was compiled in
  libtest or unittest first. This way also speeds up the build by
  eliminating 40 identical compile invocations.

  Fixes #10749

- tests: use AM_CPPFILES to modify flags in unit tests

  Using CPPFLAGS sometimes caused odd compile issues when building tests

  - In tool_setup.h override stdio.h's stderr macro as global variable
    tool_stderr.

  Both freopen and overriding the stderr macro are necessary because if
  the user-specified filename is "-" then stdout is assigned to
  tool_stderr and no freopen takes place. See the PR for more information.

  This is already how curl is documented to behave in Everything curl, but

  longer be hit.

  Closes #10740

- tests: add DELAY keyword to more tests using waits

- tests: hack to build most unit tests under cmake

  These are only built when a libcurl static library is available, since
  we're not building a special libcurlu library yet and these tests rely
  on private symbols that aren't available in the shared library. A few
  unit tests do require libcurlu, so those are not built.

- http2: fix handling of RST and GOAWAY to recognize partial transfers

  - a reset transfer (HTTP/2 RST) did not always lead to the proper
    error message on receiving its response, leading to wrong reports
    of a successful transfer
  - test_05_02 was able to trigger this condition with increased transfer
    count. The simulated response errors did not carry a 'Content-Length'
    so only proper RST handling could detect the abort
  - When doing such transfers in parallel, a connection could enter the
    state where
    a) it had been closed (GOAWAY received)
    b) the RST had not been "seen" for the transfer yet
    or c) the GOAWAY announced an error and the last successful
    stream id was not checked against ongoing transfers

  Closes #10693

- tests: use dynamic ports numbers in pytest suite

  - necessary ports are bound at start of test suite and then
    given to server fixtures for use.

    for a while

  Closes #10692

- connect: fix time_connect and time_appconnect timer statistics

    also from all eyeballing attempts, to report the maximum of
    those values.
  - added 3 test cases in test_06 to check reported values on
    successful, partially failed and totally failed connections.

- rand: use arc4random as fallback when available

  Normally curl uses cryptographically strong random provided by the
  selected SSL backend. If compiled without SSL support, a naive built-in
  function was used instead.

  Generally this was okay, but it will result in some downsides for non-
  SSL builds, such as predictable temporary file names.

  This change ensures that arc4random will be used instead, if available.

- tool: dump headers even if file is write-only

  The fixes in #10079 brought a (seemingly unrelated) change of open mode
  from `wb`/`ab` to `wb+`/`ab+` for the headerfile. This makes it no
  longer possible to write the header file to e.g. a pipe, like:

  Before this patch, enabling LDAPS required a manual C flag:

  Since abebb2b8939c6b3e0f951eb2d9ec3729b569aa2c, we set this macro for
  all Windows `wldap32` builds using `Makefile.mk`.

  For OpenLDAP builds this macro is not enough to enable LDAPS, and
  OpenLDAP is not an option in `Makefile.mk`. For Novell LDAP it might

  The future for LDAPS is that we should enable it by default without

  deleting directories to individual files. curl's custom logic now finds a lot

  - Fix and move 'clean' code that removes the output and obj directories

  Prior to this change the 'clean' code did not work right because the
  variables containing the directory names were not fully initialized and
  the rmdir syntax was sometimes incorrect (typos). DIRDIST for example
  was set to ..\builds\ and not ..\builds\$(CONFIG_NAME_LIB)\ so it would
  remove the former and not the latter. If WITH_PREFIX was set then that
  directory was removed instead.

  Also, DIRDIST (the output directory) even if initialized should not be
  removed by MakefileBuild.vc because by that time it could be set to a
  user directory that may contain other files if WITH_PREFIX is set (eg we
  don't want rmdir /s /q C:\usr\local). Therefore we remove from
  Makefile.vc before any of that happens. I added a comment in both
  makefiles explaining this.

- CURLOPT_PIPEWAIT: allow waited reuse also for subsequent connections

  As tested in test_02_07, when firing off 200 urls with --parallel, 199
  wait for the first connection to be established. if that is multiuse,
  urls are added up to its capacity.

  The first url over capacity opens another connection. But subsequent
  urls found the same situation and open a connection too. They should
  have waited for the second connection to actually connect and make its
  capacity known.

  This change fixes that by

  - setting `connkeep()` early in the HTTP setup handler. as otherwise
    a new connection is marked as closeit by default and not considered
    for multiuse at all
  - checking the "connected" status for a candidate always and continuing
    to PIPEWAIT if no alternative is found.

  - sscanf() is rather complex and slow, strchr() much simpler

  - the port number function does not need to fully verify the IPv6 address

- CONTRIBUTE: More formally specify the commit description

  This codifies what people have actually used in git commits over the

  duplicate others and tried to describe a consistent use for several
  others that were used more arbitrarily.

  This makes it easier for new committers to find out the kinds of things
  we want to acknowledge, makes it easier to perform statistical analysis
  on commits, and opens the possibility of performing lint checks on
  descriptions before submission.

- windows: always use curl's basename() implementation

  The `basename()` [1][2] implementation provided by mingw-w64 [3] makes
  assumptions about input encoding and may break with non-ASCII strings.

  `basename()` was auto-detected with CMake, autotools and since
  68fa9bf3f5d7b4fcbb57619f70cb4aabb79a51f6 (2022-10-13), also in
  `Makefile.mk` after syncing its behaviour with the mainline build
  methods. A similar patch for curl-for-win broke official Windows
  builds earlier, in release 7.83.1_4 (2022-06-15).

  This patch forces all Windows builds to use curl's internal
  `basename()` implementation to avoid such problems.

- openldap: fix missing sasl symbols at build in specific configs

  If curl is built with openldap support (USE_OPENLDAP=1) but does not
  have also some other protocol (IMAP/SMTP/POP3) enabled that brings
  in Curl_sasl_* functions, then the build will fail with undefined
  references to various symbols:

  ld: ../lib/.libs/libcurl.so: undefined reference to `Curl_sasl_decode_mech'
  ld: ../lib/.libs/libcurl.so: undefined reference to `Curl_sasl_parse_url_auth
  _option'
  ld: ../lib/.libs/libcurl.so: undefined reference to `Curl_sasl_cleanup'
  ld: ../lib/.libs/libcurl.so: undefined reference to `Curl_sasl_can_authentica
  te'
  ld: ../lib/.libs/libcurl.so: undefined reference to `Curl_sasl_continue'
  ld: ../lib/.libs/libcurl.so: undefined reference to `Curl_sasl_start'
  ld: ../lib/.libs/libcurl.so: undefined reference to `Curl_sasl_init'

  This was tracked down to these functions bein used in openldap.c but
  defined in curl_sasl.c and then forward in two vauth/ files to have
  a guard against a set of #define configurations that was now extended
  to cover also this case.

  Example configuration targeted that could reproduce the problem:

- curl_setup: Disable by default recv-before-send in Windows

  Prior to this change a workaround for Windows to recv before every send
  was enabled by default. The way it works is a recv is called before
  every send and saves the received data, in case send fails because in
  Windows apparently that can wipe out the socket's internal received
  data buffer.

  This feature has led to several bugs because the way libcurl operates
  it waits on a socket to read or to write, and may not at all times
  check for buffered receive data.

  Two recent significant bugs this workaround caused:
  - Broken Schannel TLS 1.3 connections (#9431)
  - HTTP/2 arbitrary hangs (#10253)

  The actual code remains though it is disabled by default. Though future
  changes to connection filter buffering could improve the situation IMO
  it's just not tenable to manage this workaround.

    is started for HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 via TCP
  - both attempts are subject to IPv6/IPv4 eyeballing, same
    as happens for other connections
  - tie timeout to the ip-version HAPPY_EYEBALLS_TIMEOUT
  - use a `soft` timeout at half the value. When the soft timeout
    expires, the HTTPS-CONNECT filter checks if the QUIC filter
    has received any data from the server. If not, it will start
    the HTTP/2 attempt.

  HTTP/3(ngtcp2) improvements.
  - setting call_data in all cfilter calls similar to http/2 and vtls filters
    for use in callback where no stream data is available.
  - returning CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE for prematurely terminated transfers
  - enabling pytest test_05 for h3
  - shifting functionality to "connect" UDP sockets from ngtcp2
    implementation into the udp socket cfilter. Because unconnected
    UDP sockets are weird. For example they error when adding to a
    pollset.

  HTTP/3(quiche) improvements.
  - fixed upload bug in quiche implementation, now passes 251 and pytest
  - error codes on stream RESET
  - improved debug logs
  - handling of DRAIN during connect
  - limiting pending event queue

  HTTP/2 cfilter improvements.
  - use LOG_CF macros for dynamic logging in debug build
  - fix CURLcode on RST streams to be CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE
  - enable pytest test_05 for h2
  - fix upload pytests and improve parallel transfer performance.

  GOAWAY handling for ngtcp2/quiche
  - during connect, when the remote server refuses to accept new connections
    and closes immediately (so the local conn goes into DRAIN phase), the
    connection is torn down and a another attempt is made after a short grace
    period.
    This is the behaviour observed with nghttpx when we tell it to  shut
    down gracefully. Tested in pytest test_03_02.

  TLS improvements
  - ALPN selection for SSL/SSL-PROXY filters in one vtls set of functions, repl
  aces
    copy of logic in all tls backends.
  - standardized the infof logging of offered ALPNs
  - ALPN negotiated: have common function for all backends that sets alpn propr
  ty
    and connection related things based on the negotiated protocol (or lack the
  reof).

  - new tests/tests-httpd/scorecard.py for testing h3/h2 protocol implementatio
  n.
    Invoke:
      python3 tests/tests-httpd/scorecard.py --help
    for usage.

  Improvements on gathering connect statistics and socket access.
  - new CF_CTRL_CONN_REPORT_STATS cfilter control for having cfilters
    report connection statistics. This is triggered when the connection
    has completely connected.
  - new void Curl_pgrsTimeWas(..) method to report a timer update with
    a timestamp of when it happend. This allows for updating timers
    "later", e.g. a connect statistic after full connectivity has been
    reached.
  - in case of HTTP eyeballing, the previous changes will update
    statistics only from the filter chain that "won" the eyeballing.
  - new cfilter query CF_QUERY_SOCKET for retrieving the socket used
    by a filter chain.
    Added methods Curl_conn_cf_get_socket() and Curl_conn_get_socket()
    for convenient use of this query.
  - Change VTLS backend to query their sub-filters for the socket when
    checks during the handshake are made.

  HTTP/3 documentation on how https eyeballing works.

  TLS improvements
  - ALPN selection for SSL/SSL-PROXY filters in one vtls set of functions, repl
  aces
    copy of logic in all tls backends.
  - standardized the infof logging of offered ALPNs
  - ALPN negotiated: have common function for all backends that sets alpn propr
  ty
    and connection related things based on the negotiated protocol (or lack the
  reof).

  Scorecard with Caddy.
  - configure can be run with `--with-test-caddy=path` to specify which caddy t
  o use for testing
  - tests/tests-httpd/scorecard.py now measures download speeds with caddy

  pytest improvements
  - adding Makfile to clean gen dir
  - adding nghttpx rundir creation on start
  - checking httpd version 2.4.55 for test_05 cases where it is needed. Skippin
  g with message if too old.
  - catch exception when checking for caddy existance on system.

- urlapi: avoid Curl_dyn_addf() for hex outputs

  Closes #10312

- cf-socket: improvements in socket I/O handling

  - Curl_write_plain/Curl_read_plain have been eliminated. Last code use
    now uses Curl_conn_send/recv so that requests use conn->send/revc
    callbacks which defaults to cfilters use.
  - Curl_recv_plain/Curl_send_plain have been internalized in cf-socket.c.
  - USE_RECV_BEFORE_SEND_WORKAROUND (active on Windows) has been moved
    into cf-socket.c. The pre_recv buffer is held at the socket filter
    context.  `postponed_data` structures have been removed from
    `connectdata`.
  - the hanger in HTTP/2 request handling was a result of read buffering
    on all sends and the multi handling is not prepared for this. The
    following happens:

     - multi preforms on a HTTP/2 easy handle
     - h2 reads and processes data
     - this leads to a send of h2 data
     - which receives and buffers before the send
     - h2 returns
     - multi selects on the socket, but no data arrives (its in the buffer alre
  ady)
     the workaround now receives data in a loop as long as there is something i
  n
     the buffer. The real fix would be for multi to change, so that `data_pendi
  ng`
     is evaluated before deciding to wait on the socket.

  io_buffer, optional, in cf-socket.c, http/2 sets state.drain if lower
  filter have pending data.

  This io_buffer is only available/used when the
  -DUSE_RECV_BEFORE_SEND_WORKAROUND is active, e.g. on Windows
  configurations. It also maintains the original checks on protocol
  handler being HTTP and conn->send/recv not being replaced.

  The HTTP/2 (nghttp2) cfilter now sets data->state.drain when it finds
  out that the "lower" filter chain has still pending data at the end of
  its IO operation. This prevents the processing from becoming stalled.

- write-out.d: clarify Windows % symbol escaping

  - Clarify that in Windows batch files the % must be escaped as %%, and
    at the command prompt it cannot be escaped which could lead to
    incorrect expansion.

  Prior to this change the doc implied % must be escaped as %% in win32
  always.

  ---

  Examples showing how a write-out argument is received by curl:

  If curl --write-out "%{http_code}" is executed in a batch file:
  {http_code}

  If curl --write-out "%%{http_code}" is executed in a batch file:
  %{http_code}

  If curl --write-out "%{http_code}" is executed from the command prompt:
  %{http_code}

  If curl --write-out "%%{http_code}" is executed from the command prompt:
  %%{http_code}

  At the command prompt something like "%{speed_download}%{http_code}"
  would first be parsed by the command interpreter as %{speed_download}%
  and would be expanded as environment variable {speed_download} if it
  existed, though that's highly unlikely since Windows environment names
  don't use braces.

  NSS currently uses the default Curl_none_data_pending() method which
  always returns false, causing TLS buffered input data to be missed.

  The current commit implements the nss_data_pending() method that properly
  monitors the presence of available TLS data.

  Ref:#10077

  Closes #10225

- CURLOPT_HEADERDATA.3: warn DLL users must set write function

  - Warn that in Windows if libcurl is running from a DLL and if
    CURLOPT_HEADERDATA is set then CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION or
    CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION must be set as well, otherwise the user may
    experience crashes.

  We already have a similar warning in CURLOPT_WRITEDATA. Basically, in
  Windows libcurl could crash writing a FILE pointer that was created by
  a different C runtime. In Windows each DLL that is part of a program may
  or may not have its own C runtime.

- runtests: fix detection of TLS backends

  Built-in TLS backends are detected at test time by scanning for their
  names in the version string line returned by the cli tool: as this line
  may also list the libssh configuration that mentions its own backend,
  the curl backend may be wrongly determined.

  In example, if the version line contains "libssh/0.10.4/openssl/zlib",
  OpenSSL is detected as a curl-configured backend even if not.

  This fix requires the backend names to appear as full words preceded by
  spacing in the version line to be recognized as curl TLS backends.

  Closes #10236

- quic: rename vquic implementations, fix for quiche build.

  - quiche in debug mode did not build, fixed.
  - moved all vquic implementation files to prefix curl_* to avoid
    the potential mixups between provided .h files and our own.
  - quich passes test 2500 and 2502. 2501, the POST, fail with
    the body being rejected. Quich bug?

  Closes #10242

- sectransp: fix for incomplete read/writes

  SecureTransport expects result code errSSLWouldBlock when the requested
  length could not be sent/recieved in full. The previous code returned
  noErr, which let SecureTransport to believe that the IO had terminated
  prematurely.

- tool_operate: fix headerfile writing

  Do not rely on the first transfer started to be the first to get a
  response (remember -Z). All transfers now write the headefile (-D) in
  append mode, making sure that the order of transfer responses does not
  lead to overwrites of previous data.

- http2: fix compiler warning due to uninitialized variable

  Prior to this change http2_cfilter_add could return an uninitialized
  cfilter pointer in an OOM condition. In this case though, the pointer
  is discarded and not dereferenced so there was no risk of a crash.
