# `--include`

Include response headers in the output. HTTP response headers can include
things like server name, cookies, date of the document, HTTP version and
more... With non-HTTP protocols, the "headers" are other server communication.

To view the request headers, consider the --verbose option.

Prior to 7.75.0 curl did not print the headers if --fail was used in
combination with this option and there was error reported by server.
