#
# For testing purposes you can override these by setting any of the
# variables or PKGVERSION or PORTVERSION in the environment, but this
# should not be done routinely:

: ${PKG_MAJOR_VERSION:="1"}
: ${PKG_MINOR_VERSION="2"}
: ${PKG_PATCH_LEVEL="99"}

: ${PORTREVISION:=}
: ${PORTEPOCH:=}

# Define this to a true value in the environment if creating a
# snapshot
: ${CREATE_SNAPSHOT:="NO"}
