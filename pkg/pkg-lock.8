.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to lock packages against reinstallation,
modification or deletion.
.Nm "pkg unlock"
unlocks the named packages.
Either variant only has an effect on currently installed packages.
Consequently it is impossible to block installation of a new package
by using this mechanism, unless such an installation implies updating
a locked package.
.Pp
The impact of locking a package is wider than simply preventing
modifications to the package itself.
.Cm Any
operation implying modification of the locked package will be
blocked.
This includes:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Attempts to reinstall, up- or downgrade or delete the locked package
itself.
.It
Installation, up- or downgrade of a package where the resultant
package would have a dependency on a different version of the locked
package.
.It
Deletion, up- or downgrade of any package the locked package depends
upon, either directly or as a consequence of installing or upgrading
some third package.
