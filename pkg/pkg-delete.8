.Nd deletes packages from the database and the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DfginqRxy
.Ar pkg-name ...
.Nm
.Op Fl Dnqy
.Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for deleting installed packages from the system.
.Nm
creates a work-list of all the installed packages matching the package
names on the command line.
The list is presented to the user.
If the user confirms that they do want to remove those packages, or
if the
.Cm ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES
configuration option is set,
.Nm
proceeds to remove the listed packages.
.Pp
If the set of packages to be deleted would leave installed packages
with unfulfilled dependencies,
.Nm
will emit an error message and quit without deleting anything unless
forced to proceed by the
.Fl f
option.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width F1
.It Fl a
Deletes all installed packages from the system and empties the database.
.It Fl D
If a deinstallation script exists for a given package, do not execute it.
.It Fl f
Forces packages to be removed despite leaving unresolved dependencies.
.It Fl g
Treat the package names as shell glob patterns.
.It Fl i
Make the standard or regular expression
.Fl ( x )
matching against
.Ar pkg-name
case insensitive.
.It Fl n
Dry run mode.
The list of packages to delete is always printed, but no packages are
actually deleted.
.It Fl q
Force quiet output, except where
.Fl n
is also used, when
.Nm
will show the list of packages to be deleted.
.It Fl R
Delete all packages that require the listed packages as well.
.It Fl x
Treat the package names as regular expressions according to the
"modern" or "extended" syntax of
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Fl y
Assume yes when asked for confirmation before package deletion.
