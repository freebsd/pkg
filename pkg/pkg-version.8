.Nd summarize installed versions of packages
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl hoqvU
.Op Fl l Ar limchar
.Op Fl L Ar limchar
.Op Fl xge Ar pattern
.Op Fl r Ar reponame
.Op Fl O Ar origin

.Nm
.Fl T Ar <pkgname> Ar <pattern>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for generating a report of packages installed by
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Pp
By default, if a ports tree exists it is used to compare versions.
If it does not exist, the remote repository catalogue is used.
These defaults can be overridden by specifying one of
.Fl P ,
.Fl R
or
.Fl I .
.Pp
When comparing package versions the package name and a comparison character are printed:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Li =
The installed version of the package is current.
.It Li \&<
The installed version of the package is older than the current version.
.It Li \&>
The installed version of the package is newer than the current version.
This situation can arise with an out-of-date index file, or when
testing new ports.
.It Li \&?
The installed package does not appear in the index.
This could be due to an out of date index or a package taken from a PR
that has not yet been committed.
.It Li \&!
The installed package exists in the index but for some reason,
.Nm
was unable to compare the version number of the installed package
with the corresponding entry in the index.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width F1
.It Fl h
Displays usage information
.It Fl I
Use INDEX file for determining if a package is out of date.
.It Fl P
Use ports for determining if a package is out of date.
This is the default if a ports tree exists.
The tree used can be overridden by PORTSDIR, see
.Xr pkg 5
for more information.
.It Fl R
Use repository catalogue for determining if a package is out of date.
This is the default if no ports tree exists.
.It Fl U
Suppress the automatic update of the local copy of the repository catalogue
from remote.
This only has any effect in combination with the
.Fl R
option.
Note: the
.Fl L
option is comonly used for this purpose in other
.Nm pkg
applications.
.It Fl r Ar reponame
Use the given
.Ar reponame
for comparison when using
.Fl R
.It Fl o
Display package origin, instead of package name.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
Less output will be produced.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.It Fl l Ar limchar
Display only the packages which status flag matches the one specified by
.Ar limchar
.It Fl L Ar limchar
Does the opposite of
.Fl l
flag.
Displays the packages which status flag does not match the one
specified by
.Ar limchar
.It Fl x Ar pattern
Only display the packages that match the regular expression.
Uses the "modern" or "extended" syntax of
.Xr re_format 7 .
.It Fl g Ar pattern
Only display the packages that match the glob expression.
.It Fl e Ar string
Only display the packages that exactly match the string.
.It Fl O Ar origin
Display only the packages which origin matches
.Ar origin
.It Fl t Ar <version1> Ar <version2>
Test a pair of version number strings and exit.
The output consists of one of the single characters
.Li =
(equal),
.Li \&<
(right-hand number greater), or
.Li \&>
(left-hand number greater) on standard output.
This flag is mostly useful for scripts or for testing.
.It Fl T Ar <pkgname> Ar <pattern>
Compare
.Ar <pkgname>
against shell glob
.Ar <pattern> and set exit code accordingly.
.Fl T
can also be used in `filter mode':
When one of the arguments is `-', standard input is used, and lines
with matching package names/patterns are echoed to standard output.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm .
See
.Xr pkg.conf 5
for further description.
.Bl -tag -width ".Ev NO_DESCRIPTIONS"
.It PKG_DBDIR
.It PORTSDIR
.El
.Sh FILES
See
.Xr pkg.conf 5 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is a typical invocation of the
.Nm
command, which checks the installed packages against the local ports
index file:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg version -v
.Pp
The command below generates a report against the versions in the repository catalogue:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg update
.Dl % pkg version -vR
.Pp
The following lists packages needing upgrade, compared to the repository catalogue:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg update
.Dl % pkg version -vRL=
.Pp
The following command compares two package version strings:
.Pp
.Dl % pkg version -t 1.5 1.5.1
