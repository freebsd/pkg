If a package is found to exists in more than one package
repository the first matching repository is the one that the
package will be first tried to be fetched from.

If fetching from the repository fails for some reason the next
repository, which the package is found to exist is the one that is
tried until the package is fetched, or all repositories are tried.

Multiple package repositories is activated only when the environment
