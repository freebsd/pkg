.Sh NAME
.Nm "pkg repo"
.Nd creates a package repository catalogue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl fq
.Ao Ar repo-path Ac Op Ar rsa-key
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for creating a catalogue of the available
packages in a repository.
.Nm
catalogues are necessary for sharing your package repository with
other people.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked it creates a package repository catalogue (repo.sqlite),
with an optional cryptographic signature, as a compressed tarball
(repo.txz).
Repository users download and cache this on their local machines,
for fast lookup of available packages by programs such as
.Xr pkg-install 8 .
.Pp
To create a package repository catalogue you must specify the
top-level directory where all the packages are stored as
.Ar repo-path .
.Nm
will search the filesystem beneath
.Ar repo-path
to find all the packages it contains.
Symbolic links are ignored, and only the most recent package for each
origin is included in the catalogue.
If a catalogue already exists, it will be updated incrementally with
any changes to the package collection.
This is a significant time savings for large package repositories.
.Pp
Optionally you may sign the repository catalogue by specifying the
path to an RSA private key as the
.Ar rsa-key
argument.
Signing the catalogue is strongly recommended.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width F1
.It Fl q
Force quiet output
.It Fl f
Force a full rebuild of the package catalogue, discarding any previous
content
