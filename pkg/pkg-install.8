.Sh NAME
.Nm "pkg install"
.Nd installs packages from remote package repositories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl AfgLnqRXxy
.Op Fl r Ar reponame
.Ar <pkg-origin> ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used for installation of packages from a remote package
repository.
Multiple package names can be specified on the command line, either
explicitly or by matching against package names in the repository
catalogues using shell globbing; standard- or extended regular
expressions.
.Pp
.Nm
creates a work-list of all the package installations to do.
Any already installed and up to date packages will be dropped from the
list unless the
.Fl f
(force) option is supplied, in which case those packages will be
reinstalled.
The dependencies of packages in the list are examined and any missing
packages are added to the list for installation.
Such implicitly added packages are flagged as candidates for
autoremoval.
See
.Xr pkg-autoremove 8
for details.
Any already installed but out of date packages, either named on the
command line or from the sum of all their dependencies are added to
the work list as upgrade jobs.
The work list is sorted into dependency order and
.Nm
will present it to the user for approval before proceeding, unless
overridden by the
.Fl y
option or the
.Cm ASSUME_ALWAYS_YES
setting in
.Fa pkg.conf .
.Pp
Autoremoval flags are sticky, and will persist over reinstallation or
upgrade of the packages concerned, even if subsequently the packages
are named explicitly on a command line.
See
.Xr pkg-query 8
for finding the autoremoval status of a package, and
.Xr pkg-set 8
for modifying it.
.Pp
Currently
.Nm
will only use one repository to install packages from.
When
.Ev PACKAGESITE
is set in the environment, or the equivalent
.Cm PACKAGESITE
setting is present in
.Fa pkg.conf
only that site will be used.
.Pp
Alternatively, when in multi-repo mode, the
.Fl r
option may be used to select one of the package repositories listed
in the configuration file.
Otherwise the default repository will be used.
.Pp
Multiple package repository support is only activated when neither the
environment variable
.Ev PACKAGESITE
nor the equivalent
.Cm PACKAGESITE
configuration setting are defined.
.Pp
Package repository catalogues will be automatically updated whenever
.Xr pkg-update 8
is run, unless disabled by the
.Fl L
flag.
Updating repository catalogues is highly recommended before doing any
package installation with
.Nm .
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm :
.Bl -tag -width F1
.It Fl A
Mark the installed packages as orphan.
Will be automatically removed if no other packages depend on them.
For more information please refer to
.Xr pkg-autoremove 8
.It Fl f
Force the reinstallation of the package if already installed.
.It Fl g
Treat the package names as shell glob patterns.
.It Fl L
Skip updating the repository catalogues with
.Xr pkg-update 8 .
Use the locally cached copies only.
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
The list of changes to packages is always printed, but
no changes are actually made.
.It Fl q
Force quiet output, except when
.Fl n
is used, where
.Nm
will always show packages to be installed, upgraded or deleted.
.It Fl R
When used with
.Fl f ,
reinstalls any packages that require the given package.
.It Fl r Ar reponame
In multi-repo mode, override the
.Fa pkg.conf
ordering and only attempt to download packages from the named
repository.
.It Fl X
Treat the package names as extended regular expressions.
.It Fl x
Treat the package names as regular expressions.
.It Fl y
Assume yes when asked for confirmation before package installation.
