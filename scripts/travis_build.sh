# This script is run as the 'script' step in .travis.yml.  Have a standalone
# script is better than listing multiple scripts in .travis.yml for several
# reasons:
# 1 - It allows for condition logic
# 2 - We can bail out on the first failure (set -x).  Travis will always try
#     to run all the scripts so, for example, it will try to run 'make' even
#     if 'configure' fails.
# 3 - It allows developers to easily, with a single command re-produce what
#     travis is doing.
